## Manual Deployment Guide

To get a clean URL (e.g., `dhiran28.github.io`), follow these steps exactly:

1. **Download** the project files and unzip them.
2. **Create a Repository** on GitHub named **`Dhiran28.github.io`**.
   * *Note: It must match your username exactly.*
3. **Open Terminal** in the project folder and run these commands:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Dhiran28/Dhiran28.github.io.git
git push -u origin main --force
```

4. **GitHub Actions** will automatically build and deploy your site.
5. Wait for the Action to finish (look for a green checkmark in the "Actions" tab).
6. Your site will be live at **`https://dhiran28.github.io/`**.

## Setup for Local Development
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
